# AoC2023-Haskell
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles

### Thoughts
The solutions are run all together in the [Main](src/Main.hs) module,
compiled down to a single optimized executable.
<br>
The answers are obviously specific to the inputs, which is why I made it so that anyone
can build and run the project with their own inputs (although I tested the program only on Linux).

This was my very first ever [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
and I had a lot of conflicting feelings and opinions about it.
<br>
In the end, I'm glad I tried and made it to the end, despite taking a lot of time
and the puzzle solutions not being all original (had some help from **Reddit** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)
and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/)) or optimized enough to run in less than a second.

The best part was surely learning a lot of new stuff about Haskell and all the different topics that inspired the puzzles,
as well as how to approach problems with a "heavily functional mindset" ðŸ˜†

Some additional things I learned during **AoC2023** are: [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/)
project management, Haskell program profiling, multiple language extensions and pragmas usage, some more commonly used and useful libraries,
point-free style (slightly obfuscating code), better understanding of Functor-Applicative-Monad, file handling and resources embedding.
