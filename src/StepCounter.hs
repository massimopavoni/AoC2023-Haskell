-- This is not a fair problem: it had very specific properties that made the second part not fun.
-- What I am thinking is that crafting 25 puzzles this well thought out and maintaining a level
-- that's good for most of the people who try and solve them is not easy,
-- and sometimes one (the craftsman) can have some difficulties and not really be able
-- to avoid some of the things I would consider pitfalls,
-- like slightly overfitting some parts of the puzzle to the peculiar input.

-- The first part is easy enough, since it just involves a breadth-first search.

-- The second part is the annoying thing I mentioned above.
-- I don't care how ingenious the puzzle can be, it is not fun to solve it if it requires you
-- to analyze the properties of the special input and find a random quadratic progression
-- in the growth of the number of reachable plots.
-- That being said, I read other people's thoughts on it and analyzed the input on my own,
-- plotting the relationship between the number of steps and the number of reachable plots,
-- realizing the actual quadratic curve and then implementing a solution using
-- the hmatrix package to solve the linear system for the coefficients
-- (exploring the package was one of the few fun parts, at least).
-- We even have to choose specific steps to analyze, since the quadratic function works well for numbers
-- that are congruent to 65 modulo 131, since the input has a width and height of 131
-- and the edge of the garden tile can be reached in 65 steps without encountering any rocks.
-- I didn't try making the choice of the sample steps and step points depend on the input size,
-- but I still have serious doubts that the solution would work for any other type of input,
-- especially because of the visible empty garden plots diamond
-- (it's just my guess, but that might be part of the reason why the growth follows a pattern
-- that can be used to make accurate predictions on the answer for different step numbers),
-- and because of the precise number of steps mentioned in the puzzle description
-- (26501365 is indeed congruent to 65 modulo 131, even though maybe this property only makes
-- the result precise for those numbers and an approximation to be rounded for different values).

-- The breadth-first-search itself is straightforward enough.
-- The only quirks are saving the previous positions to avoid visiting them again
-- (and making use of a set for it, because we can simply use their Monoid instance with foldMap',
-- which is pretty nice for the knowledge I have, not still having studied the type classes
-- that take from Algebra and Category Theory).
